    {
      "question": "What makes your matcha 'not-as-bitter'?",
      "answer": "We use only ceremonial-grade matcha from Uji, Kyoto, which is naturally sweeter and less bitter than culinary grade. Our careful preparation at the right temperature (175°F) preserves the delicate flavors."
    },

      "question": "Do you offer dairy-free options?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer oat milk, coconut milk, and almond milk alternatives for all our drinks at no extra charge for most options."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ceremonial grade matcha?",
      "answer": "Ceremonial grade is the highest quality matcha, made from the youngest tea leaves with stems and veins removed. It has a vibrant green color, smooth texture, and naturally sweet taste."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I order online for pickup?",
      "answer": "Yes! You can order through our website for pickup, or use DoorDash, UberEats, or Grubhub for delivery."
